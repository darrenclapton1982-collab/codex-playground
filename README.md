# Codex Playground Monorepo

This repository holds multiple small experiments and prototypes. Each project lives in `projects/<project-name>/` and ships with its own HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and assets. Shared guidance and starter templates live at the top level so every new project starts consistent.

## Layout

- `projects/` – checked-in projects. Each folder is self-contained.
- `templates/` – boilerplates used when spinning up a new project.
- `scripts/` – optional helper scripts for repo tasks.
- `PROJECT_RULES.md` – the agreed playbook for structure and conventions.

Happy experimenting!
